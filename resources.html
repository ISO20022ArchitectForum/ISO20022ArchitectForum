<h2>Public Forum Resources</h2>
          <p>This page contains links to some public resources that describe the Forum and the work that we're doing. Please use these to inform yourself and anyone you think might be interested.</p>

<h2>Background Materials</h2>
<p>This <a href="resources/Architect_Forum_One_Page_Intro.pdf">One Page Introduction</a> is intended to introduce the Forum to business sponsors.</p>

<p><a href="resources/ISO20022_Architect_Forum_Charter_GitHub.pdf">Our Charter</a> does two things: First, it outlines the vision, objectives, conventions, membership, and commitments of “The ISO 20022 Forum for Architects” (hereafter “The Forum”), and second, it sets clear expectations for members and other interested parties 
regarding the activities and outputs of The Forum.</p>
<p><em>Important Note: By participating in the Forum and by accessing Forum resources, participants agree to the principles and conventions outlined in our charter.</em> </p>

    <h2>Forum Meeting Notes</h2>
          <p>Although the Forum primarily works as a virtual community, we do occasionally meet. When we do, notes are taken (according to Chatham House rules) - Once approved, notes are shared here.</p>
<p>Notes from the <a href="resources/150221_ISO20022_Architect_Forum_Launch_Workshop_Notes.pdf">First Launch Meeting</a> that was held Thursday May 21, 2015 at Level 39, One Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London.</p>
<p>Notes from the <a href="resources/150810_ISO20022_Architect_Forum_Launch_Workshop_Notes_Final.pdf">Second Launch Meeting</a> that was held Monday August 10, 2015 at Level 39, One Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London.</p>

<h2>Member Only Materials</h2>
