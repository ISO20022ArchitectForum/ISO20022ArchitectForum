          <h2>Welcome to the ISO 20022 Forum for Architects. </h2>

<p>Well, now that you’ve found us, let’s get two things straight from the outset:</p>

<p>1) We pronounce it “<em>Eyes-Oh Twenty-Oh-Two-Two</em>” (or “<em>ICE-Oh Twenty-Oh-Two-Two</em>”, if you must)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>2) ISO 20022 is <em>much</em> more than just another XML syntax for financial messages.</p>

<p>This Forum is an independent initiative, run <em>by</em> architects who work for financial institutions, <em>for</em> architects who work for financial institutions. The Forum is a vehicle to get more strategic industry thinkers participating in the ISO 20022 standard, because we recognise a potentially transformative platform for our industry when we see one. Through the Forum, architects of all stripes are able to explore, influence, and participate in how ISO 20022 is enriched and published.</p>

<p>Our goal is to drive ISO 20022’s evolution into <em>the</em> standard reference model for the business of finance, so we can deploy it strategically to solve the systemic challenges that our industry faces.</p>

<h2>So, you want to join the Forum?</h2>
<p>The Forum welcomes members who are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Architect profiles working for financial institutions, and</li>
<li>Familiar with the ISO 20022 standard, and</li>
<li>Ready to make active contributions to the work of The Forum, and</li>
<li>Willing to abide by the principles and conventions documented in the <a href="resources/ISO20022_Architect_Forum_Charter_GitHub.pdf">attached charter</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum membership, including full access to all Forum resources is otherwise entirely free of charge and obligation. </p>

<p>So, if you’re a [Systems | Enterprise | Information | Data | IT | Integration | Software | Solutions | Business | …] Architect who meets the above criteria, request membership now by sending a mail to <a href="mailto:A4ISO20022.Secretariat@swift.com">the Secretariat</a> to introduce yourself.</p>

<p>Among other benefits, your membership will afford you access to this <strong>private</strong> GitHub repository where the Forum gets hands-on to make the ISO 20022 content and tooling more valuable and usable to architects like you.</p>

<p>Note: When we are not working on GitHub, we will probably be networking and planning future activities over on our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grps/ISO-20022-Forum-Architects-8418031/about">Private LinkedIn Group</a>. While you’re at it, why not request membership over there too. We also have a Twitter feed that we will soon start to use for more general notifications, but this is not yet active. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/A4ISO20022" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" data-dnt="true">Follow @A4ISO20022</a>
