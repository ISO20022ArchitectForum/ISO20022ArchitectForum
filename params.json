{"name":"ISO 20022 Forum for Architects","tagline":"ISO 20022 is much more than just message definitions","body":"Welcome to the ISO 20022 Forum for Architects. \r\n\r\nOk, now that you’ve found us, let’s get two things straight from the outset:\r\n\r\n1) We pronounce it “_Eyes-Oh Twenty-Oh-Two-Two_” (or “_ICE-Oh Twenty-Oh-Two-Two_”, if you must), and \r\n\r\n2) _ISO 20022_ is *much* more than just another XML syntax for financial messages.\r\n\r\nThis Forum is an independent initiative, run by architects, for architects, as a vehicle for architects to participate in the ISO 20022 standard. Through the Forum, architects of all stripes are able to explore, inform, and influence how ISO 20022 is published. Our goal is to drive ISO 20022’s evolution into _the_ standard reference model for Finance, so we can deploy it strategically to solve the systemic challenges that our industry faces.\r\n\r\nThe Forum welcomes members who are:\r\n* Architect profiles working for financial institutions, and\r\n* Familiar with the ISO 20022 standard, and\r\n* Ready to make active contributions to the work of The Forum, and\r\n* Willing to abide by the principles and conventions documented in the attached charter.\r\n\r\nForum membership, including full access to all Forum resources is otherwise entirely free of charge and obligation. \r\n\r\nSo, if you’re a [Systems | Enterprise | Information | Data | IT | Integration | Software | Solutions | Business | …] Architect who meets the above criteria, request membership now by sending a mail to [The Secretariat](mailto:A4ISO20022.Secretariat@swift.com) to introduce yourself.\r\n\r\nAmong other benefits, your membership will afford you access to this **private** GitHub repository where the Forum gets hands-on to make the ISO 20022 content and tooling more valuable and usable to architects like you.\r\n\r\nNote: When we are not working on GitHub, we will probably be networking and planning future workstreams over on our [Private LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/grps/ISO-20022-Forum-Architects-8418031/about). While you’re at it, why not request membership over there too. We also have a Twitter feed (@A4ISO20022) that we will soon start to use for more general notifications, but this is not yet active. Feel free to follow us, even if you don’t meet the above criteria, so you’ll be in the loop when we have something of broader interest to publish.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
